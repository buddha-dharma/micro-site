I've created this website because I don't live near a dharma center
so the main way I am learning is books, videos, audio clips and exchange with other practicioners.
On this site I publish a list of the resources I find useful mainly for my own reference and 
I check them for authenticity as good as I can but I am only a layperson so take everything I share with you with a grain of salt. For your practice it is important that you connect with a teacher. In person if possible.
