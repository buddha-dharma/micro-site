I've created this website because I don't live near a dharma center so the main way I am learning is books, videos, audio clips and exchange with other practicioners. On this site I publish a list of the resources I find useful mainly for my own reference and I check them for authenticity as good as I can but I am only a layperson so take everything I share with a grain of salt. For your practice it is important that you connect with an authentic teacher, listen to dharma talks and go on retreats.
