The Buddha is no almighty, immortal deity that reigns and watches over humans. The Buddha was a human being who had a deep insight into the nature of our discomfort and the nature of the universe.

Buddhism is a path that helps us recognize our own suffering and a way out of the suffering.

A very important aspect of the practice is direct experience and instead of blind acceptance you are encouraged to experience and investigate much like the scientific method.
