The Buddha was a human being who had a deep insight into the nature of our discomfort and the nature of the universe.

Buddhism is a path that helps us recognize our own suffering and a way out of the suffering.

An important aspect of the practice is direct experience and you are encouraged to experience and investigate much like the scientific method.

You don't have to be a buddhist to profit from the Dharma and practices.
