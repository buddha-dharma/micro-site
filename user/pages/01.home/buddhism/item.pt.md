The Buddha is no almighty, immortal deity that reigns and watches over humans. The Buddha was a human being who had a deep insight into the nature of our discomfort and the nature of the universe.

Budismo é o caminho que nos ajuda a reconhecer o nosso próprio sofrimento e o caminho para nos livrármo-nos dele.

A very important aspect of the practice is direct experience and instead of blind acceptance you are encouraged to experience and investigate much like the scientific method.
