The Buddha was a human being who had a deep insight into the nature of our discomfort and the nature of the universe.

Budismo é o caminho que nos ajuda a reconhecer o nosso próprio sofrimento e o caminho para nos livrármo-nos dele.

An important aspect of the practice is direct experience and you are encouraged to experience and investigate much like the scientific method.

You don't have to be a buddhist to profit from the Dharma and practices.
