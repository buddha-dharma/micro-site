The Buddha is no almighty, immortal deity that reigns and watches over humans.
The Buddha was a human beeing who had a deep insight into the nature of our discomfort and the 
nature of the universe.

Buddhism is a path that helps us recognize our own suffering and a way out of the suffering.

Buddhism does not require an especially esoteric mind or believe in miracles. 
A very important aspect of the practice is direct experience and instead of having to blindly
accept a dogmatic message you are encouraged to experience and investigate much like the scientific method.
