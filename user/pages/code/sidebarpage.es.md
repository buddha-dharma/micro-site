title: Code of Conduct
---

This is a code of conduct for the Open Dharma Community.

- Members of an Open Dharma Meditation Group have to be informed that this code of conduct exists and it must be made available to them.

#### Open Nature

- There is no central leadership behind the project and the website. The material is Open Source and suggestions and improvments are welcome. You are encouraged to fork and expand this project.
- Open Dharma Meditation Groups are free. There are no fees or donations to unlock perks.
- Open Dharma Meditation Groups don't focus on one single teacher and his books.
- Open Dharma Meditation Groups welcome criticism from outside and take it seriously.

#### Goals

- The goal of an Open Dharma Meditation Group is to make you feel better and empower you as a human being.
- Open Dharma Meditation Groups are not quality controlled. We depend on the members of a group to report if a group does not agree with this code of conduct. If a group does not feel right, there is nothing wrong with founding your own group.
- The main goal of an Open Dharma Meditation Group is to practice together and to talk about meditation experience.
- An optional goal is to advertise the group and help people that are too far away to found and advertise their own group.

#### No Teachers and Leadership

- There are no teachers in an Open Dharma Meditation Group. Members are encouraged to use our [list of resources](https://github.com/buddha-dharma/buddhism) to find instructions by teachers. All the material that can be found on the website is written by lay people and not reviewed by a monastic, teacher or master.
