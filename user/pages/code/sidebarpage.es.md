title: Código de Conducta
---

Este es el código de conducta para la Comunidad de Open Dharma.

### Comunidad en línea de Open Dharma

- La comunidad no es un sustituto adecuado para una sangha, sino para hablar de la práctica y los desafíos.
- The goal is to connect practicioners with an authentic sangha and teacher nearby or if that is not possible at least online.

### Grupo de Meditación de Open Dharma

Si deseas formar un grupo de meditación en tu área, recomendamos adaptar estas reglas.

- Groups are not a suitable replacement for a sangha. They are for practicing together and talking about practice and challenges.
- There is no group leader or owner.
- Groups are free. There are no fees or donations to unlock perks.
- Groups don't focus on one single teacher and his books.
- Groups welcome criticism from outside and take it seriously.
- Groups are not quality controlled. We depend on members of a group to report if a group does not agree with this code of conduct. If a group does not feel right, there is nothing wrong with founding your own group.

#### Objetivos

- Connect practicioners with an authentic sangha nearby.
- Make you feel better and empower you as a human being.
- Advertise the group and help people that are too far away to found and advertise their own group.
