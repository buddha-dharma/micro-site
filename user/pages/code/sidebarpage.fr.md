title: Code de conduite
---

This is a code of conduct for the Open Dharma Community.

### Open Dharma Online Community

- The community is not a suitable replacement for a sangha. It is for talking about practice and challenges.
- The goal is to connect practicioners with an authentic sangha and teacher nearby or if that is not possible at least online.

### Open Dharma Meditation Group

If you want to form a meditation group in your area we recommend adapting these rules.

- Groups are not a suitable replacement for a sangha. They are for practicing together and talking about practice and challenges.
- There is no group leader or owner.
- Groups are free. There are no fees or donations to unlock perks.
- Groups don't focus on one single teacher and his books.
- Groups welcome criticism from outside and take it seriously.
- Groups are not quality controlled. We depend on members of a group to report if a group does not agree with this code of conduct. If a group does not feel right, there is nothing wrong with founding your own group.

#### Goals

- Connect practicioners with an authentic sangha nearby.
- Make you feel better and empower you as a human being.
- Advertise the group and help people that are too far away to found and advertise their own group.
