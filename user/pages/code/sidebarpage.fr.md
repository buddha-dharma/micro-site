title: Code de conduite
---
Ceci est un code de conduite pour les groupes Open Sangha.

- Il doit être signalé aux membre d'un Open Sangha que ce code de conduite existe et il doit être mis à leur disposition.

#### L'aspect "open"

- Il n'y a pas de leadership central derrière ce projet et ce site Web. Tout le contenu est Open Source et peut être modifié par tout le monde, et tout le monde a le droit de faire des suggestions. Si vous êtes en désaccord avec un certain aspect du contenu, vous vous sentez traité injustement par rapport à vos suggestions, vous pouvez en publier votre propre version et créer un nouveau projet. Nous vous demandons simplement de choisir un nom différent, afin de ne pas faussement représenter notre groupe.
- Open Sanghas are free. None of the services an Open Sangha provides is tied to a fee or donation.
- Open Sanghas don't focus on one single teacher and his books.
- Open Sanghas welcome criticism from outside and take it seriously.

#### Goals

- The goal of an Open Sangha is to make you feel better and empower you as a human being. If the oposite happens then try another group or practicing on your own for a while and contemplate about the reasons.
- Open Sanghas are not quality controlled we depend on the members of a group to report if a group does not agree with this code of conduct. If a group does not feel right, there is nothing wrong with founding your own group even in the same city.
- The main goal of an Open Sangha is to practice together and to talk about meditation experience.
- An optional goal is to advertise the group and help people that are too far away to found and advertise their own group.

#### No Teachers and Leadership

- Usually there are no teachers in an Open Sangha. Lay people will give basic instructions for very simple exercises. Members are encouraged to use our [list of resources](https://github.com/buddha-dharma/buddhism) to find instructions by real teachers to intesify and correct what they have learned. All the material that can be found on the website is written by lay people and not reviewed by a monastic, teacher or master.
- Open Sanghas are organized by a maintainer, nobody leads or owns the group.
- The maintainers job is to keep the group together and keep it focused on the main goal.
- In order to emphasize that nobody leads the group Open Sanghas can meet at different members homes.
